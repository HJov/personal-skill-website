            <h2 class="text-center">Skill 1: Editing in Premiere Pro</h2>
            <p>Editing is one of the most important skills to have now, you can do freelance work for others or you can edit for yourself and post videos on video platoforms such as Youtube, Instagram, or TikTok. Editing is one of the skills that's worth it to invest in, but no matter how much you do it, it takes a really long time to edit, for me Editing a 60 second video that I'm happy with takes me an hour, there's a reason why people always hire Editor first thing when they finally make Youtube their lively hood, same reason why Athletes hire Chiefs, the investment is worth it, with how much effort it takes</p>

                    <h4>Techniques</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Technique 1 is motion with pictures</li>
                        <li>Technique 2: Audio Control in Videos</li>
                        <li>Technique 2: Masking or adding Overlay in Videos</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Benefits</h4>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 1 is that motion with pictures is a great way to save time since, you can place an image by itself and has some sort of motion where the image starts out small and gets bigger or it's zoomed in and moves from left to right in the screen. This is great if you want to add in an image as B-Roll but adding a still image doesn't add to a video since it's a still image, and with current social media, there has to be some action or motion happeneing on screen, the retention of the audience needs to kept, and this makes an boring still image, into a animation or a GIF if you want to call it all you have to do is mess with the Keyframes of when to zoom at this time</li>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 2 is sometimes your audio isn't that good in a video, and Adobe Premiere Pro automatically changes the audio to fit it into a Podcast, removes all Background noises, and makes sures there's not echos, you can also manually do this, but this skill saves more time, you just need to change around the setting and fit what you like, but be warned it takes a while and uses a lot of GPU Power.</li>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 3 is that if you've ever seen funny edits of someone crying in the rain, or someone behind fire, that's some kind of overlay or mask, most of these you don't make, you usually download some pack from the Internet which does this for you, all you have to do is apply it, but a lot of people look at a video like that and expect some advanced Editing technique even though it's quite simple.</li>

            <h2 class="text-center">Skill 2: Altering Images in Photoshop</h2>
            <p>Premiere Pro and Photoshop go hand on hand, After Affects is also pretty important, but you can get by with Premiere Pro. Photoshop is really good at alternating pictures and just creating Thumbnails and making images pop out. When you click on any video either on Youtube, Facebook, IG, or TikTok, the Preview or Thumbnail is the first thing you see, so it's important to give a first impression, this is mostly done with Photoshop, and it's mostly easy find a picture that stands out on a page, and add some arrows and colors that make it pop out.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Benefits</h4>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 1: Technique 1 is pretty much when you put someone else's face or body over someone else's, so like putting a lions head on a Dog's, this works pretty well since it catches the audiences attention, and because it's pretty fun to do</li>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 2: The Magic Wand Tool is the most important tool in Photoshop, it's how you crop and edit out faces or body parts and replace them with something else's, it's also the way most of the way you clutter and add everything into the picture to make it stand out, there's a reason why it's class "Magic" Wand</li>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 3: Adding in Edits such as making someone's hair grey or photoshopping them with some sort of beard is pretty important but with AI it's getting less and less impressive, especially with Gronk AI picture which look even better than Professional Thumbnails. </li>

            <p>I took a Linux Class last semester, which let me pass the Linux Essential Exam, and I have a pretty good knowledge of Linux through the Command Terminal, but most of is knowledge in my brain since most of the Linux Questions are memorization or commands. The commands aren't that bad, but there are a lot and they are hard to memorize.</p>

                    <li>Benefit of Technique 1 is are mostly Linux commands such as cd, ls, they're pretty important for security and having important information within your PC. It's a pretty good skill to have if your trying to teach someone about Linxu.</li>
                    <li>Benefit of Technique 2 is your able to Pass Linux Exam, and if anyone asks you about Linux in interviews for a job, you can answer or flex on them.</li>
